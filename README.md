The idea is just to create a simple application that access a user's Twitter account and caches a prefixed number of tweets.
This can be useful for example when a user is about to enter in a place where there's no connectivity (i.e. tube) and he still wants to access Twitter's tweets from there.

The application is just an exercise after finishing the Android course available on coursera.org, so it's not meant to be release in the play store, and the support might be dropped at any time.
